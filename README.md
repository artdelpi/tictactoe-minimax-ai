This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in Java, featuring an AI opponent that makes strategic decisions based on the Minimax state-space search algorithm. The game supports two play modes:
1. **Player vs. Player** - Two players take turns to compete against each other on the same machine.
2. **Player vs. Computer (AI)** - The player competes against a computer-controlled opponent using the Minimax algorithm to simulate strategic gameplay.
